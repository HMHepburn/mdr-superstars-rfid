# mdr-superstars-rfid
Java client which manages connection to a websocket server as well as controlling CAEN RFID reader

**IMPORTANT:** You might have to modify some components of the code for this application to work

1. In Superstarsrfid.java - modify the websocket URL as desired such that the websocket can connect
2. In RFIDReader.java - modify the COM5 value to match the USB port that your RFID reader has been plugged into

I will update this file as needed
